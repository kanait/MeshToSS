Installation using MSVC++5

MSVC++5 Projects (*.dsp) and workspace files (*.dsw) are included for libvrml97core and 
libvrml97gl as well as the generated parser/lexer sources .

Workspace file for libvrml97core is kept in libvrml97\libvrml97core\win32 and for
libvrml97gl is kept in libvrml97\libvrml97gl\win32.

Generated parser/lexer sources are kept in libvrml97\libvrml97core\src\vrml97.

For building libvrml97core and libvrml97gl library, you need to set include directories
GLUT, PNG, Zlib and JPEG library by Tools->Options->Directories in MSVC++5.

For building javascript dll library (libvrml97js32.lib and libvrml97js32.dll), workspace file 
libvrml97js.dsw is given in libvrml97\libvrml97js\win32 directory.

For making all libraries (libvrml97core, libvrml97gl and libvrml97js), workspace file
libvrml97.dsw is kept in libvrml97\win32.
